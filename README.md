## Cancer Incidence Analysis using Linear Regression

The nexus between incomes and health outcomes is analysed to identify population groups prone to cancer to help with better prognosis. In this work, we examine whether low-income groups are at a greater risk of being diagonsed and dying from cancer. The following were discussed/analysed in this work:

- Math behind Linear Regression (Exact and Gradient Descent Solution)
- Case study on socio-economic factors such as income, poverty, subscription to health insurance with incidence and mortality rate of cancer.
- Statistical Evidence of the analysis.

## Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

The Titanic Kaggle Competition problem is addressed using Logistic Regression in this assignment. The following were discussed/analysed:

- Math behind Logistic Regression, learning model parameters using Gradient descent, regularization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis on features, handling missing values, feature engineering such as extracting title among the name.
- Logistic Regression Model, Gaussian Kernelised Logistic Regression and Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Area under ROC)

## US Income Classifier using Naive Bayes

In this work, we demonstrate the application of Naive Bayes classifier illustrated through the 1994 Census Bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. The following were discussed/analysed:

- Math behind Naive Bayes, reasoning behind naive assumption, common modelling choices for conditional probability P(x|y=C) (Gaussian and Categorical)
- Exploratory Data Analysis on class imbalance, density distribution of features
- Writing Naive Bayes for both numerical and categorical features and Model Evaluation.
